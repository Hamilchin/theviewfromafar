                <p>&quot;O, <strong>WHAT A WORLD</strong> of unseen visions and heard silences, this insubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, these touchless rememberings and unshowable reveries! ... A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet may do. An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror. This consciousness that is myself of selves, that is everything, and yet nothing at allâ€”what is it?<br>And where did it come from?<br>And why?&quot;</p>

<h3>Part 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>There are few problems in the history of thought that have been so enduring as the problem of consciousness. Our minds aim not only to know what we are made of, or how we act, but <em>why</em> we are - that is, why there is a way, a feeling, that it is like <em>to be</em>. And yet, a satisfactory answer has eluded us. We have given many names to this problem, among them, the Hard Problem of Consciousness, which formulates the question in terms of the existence of so-called <em>qualia</em>, or subjective experience. These terms, the ones that refer to experience itself, are remarkably difficult to describe rigorously. Perhaps it is not surprising that words so often fail to describe consciousness, for if we could describe it entirely, we would be well on our way to solving the problem. And thus, we are forced to ask, and answer, a question whose meaning is not well defined. Understandably, we have failed. </p>
<p>The meaning of the word consciousness has obscured genuine progression on this problem. It has taken on a life of its own; the ideas of self-awareness, experience, existence, identity, and thought have all been tossed about in the semantic playground that is the definition of consciousness. We often hear talk about machines becoming &quot;self aware&quot;, but we ourselves are unaware if this is equivalent to machines being able to think, or experience, or to have a sense of identity, or whether these are in fact the same thing (I posit that they are not.). Before hoping to make any progression on the problem, we must first untangle the meaning behind consciousness. </p>
<p>Yet the Hard Problem itself - &quot;why am I conscious?&quot; - is also ill-formed, for it presupposes that I am, in fact, conscious. There is an implication there that is not justified. When discussing the existence of things we cannot even coherently describe, it is much better to be skeptical. We are in an environment where we must take great care before taking thoughts at face-value, for we are trying to analyze the very mechanism that allows us to make claims regarding our experience. There is a related question, one that I believe is the &quot;true&quot; problem of consciousness, and it is as follows: </p>
<p>&quot;Why do we believe that we are conscious?&quot;</p>
<p>This is a problem that Chalmers has described as a &quot;meta-question&quot;, one that is merely related to, and may inform, the hard problem of consciousness. This is incorrect. In fact, as we will see, the only question that has any functional significance is the latter. To answer this &quot;meta-question&quot; is to solve the hard problem, for if a). We discover that we believe we are conscious while not being truly conscious, the &quot;Hard Problem&quot; is meaningless, and if b). we discover that we believe we are conscious for good reason, and describe this process of belief entirely, we will have captured consciousness in its entirety. For there is a self-referentiality to the question; if consciousness is a requisite for belief, explaining why we believe we are conscious necessitates an explanation for consciousness itself. </p>
<p>Let us make an honest attempt at a solution to this problem of consciousness, or rather the belief that we are conscious. </p>

<h3>Part 2: Dialogue</h3>
<p>Dramatis personae: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plato, who believes in his own consciousness<br>Socrates, who knows nothing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plato: What do you mean by &quot;conscious&quot;, Socrates? I find it difficult to answer your question without first defining our terms well.</p>
<p>Socrates: This is a good instinct, Plato, for many people have given up on the road to truth because the meanings of their terms were too difficult for them to decipher. For now, let us regard consciousness as what you might describe as subjective experience, or &quot;feelings&quot;, or the &quot;way it is like to be.&quot; </p>
<p>Plato: So you ask what it means that I experience? (author&#39;s note, the hard problem of consciousness)</p>
<p>Socrates: Precisely. </p>
<p>Plato: This is a simple question, Socrates, and yet a difficult one. For much of how we ascribe meaning to terms is dependent on experience, so to try and define experience in terms of itself... words seem inadequate. </p>
<p>Socrates: Yes, there does seem to be a tricky self-referentiality about it. Perhaps this is why our scholars have become so hopelessly lost trying to answer this question. </p>
<p>Plato: Perhaps I can start by describing what I experience at this point in time, and it might get us closer to uncovering what experience itself is. As I sit on this bench with you, there is a certain way the bench <em>feels</em>. As I look in the sky, I see a blue-ness that I cannot describe physically, but nonetheless <em>see</em>. </p>
<p>Socrates: Hold on one second. What do you mean that you cannot describe it physically? Last I checked, the wavelength of blue light was around 500 nanometers. Is this not what blue is? </p>
<p>Plato: This much is true. But there is a certain essence of the experience of blue-ness that seems indescribable in physical terms. If I told a blind person everything there was to know about physical, external blue-ness, like the wavelength, intensity, angle, and what have you, they would nonetheless be unable to qualitatively experience <em>seeing blue</em>. There seems to be a sort of &quot;way it is like&quot; that you can only feel through experience. </p>
<p>Socrates: Interesting. Continue. </p>
<p>Plato: Of course, not only can I experience what is happening right now, at this moment, but I can also remember things that have happened in the past. When I recall my childhood memories, I am able to see them &quot;in my mind&#39;s eye.&quot; This, too, seems a sort of experience. Not only that, I find that I am able to imagine things that have never even happened! Experience is not restricted to your physical body, it seems. Daydreaming, for instance, yields a sort of experience that is removed from reality. Thoughts, too, can be experienced; when I contemplate deeply a geometry problem, or reminisce upon the past, or imagine possible futures, I am aware of the way it <em>feels</em>. </p>
<p>Socrates: Ah. But when you say you are &quot;aware of the way it feels,&quot; what exactly do you mean?</p>
<p>Plato: I am aware of experiences because I can inspect them.</p>
<p>Socrates: And how do you know that you have inspected them?</p>
<p>Plato: Well, because I am aware of having inspected them. Ah, but I see your point. My explanation of awareness seems self-referential, in the same peculiar way that trying to define experience seemed self-referential. </p>
<p>Socrates: You have described the sky, and this bench. And so I seem to know, at least, that you are aware of them, in the sense that you acknowledged them. But you did not merely say that you were aware of them. You said that you <em>experienced</em> them. That there was a <em>subjective experience</em> associated with the chair, and the sky, and imagination, and memory. Where, exactly, is this experience? </p>
<p>Plato: Are you calling into question the very fact that I experience? Well, first, as I have said, I am aware of having experienced! </p>
<p>Socrates: Very good! But let me ask you this: is it possible to know that you have experienced, without having been aware of it? </p>
<p>Plato: I suppose, since I was not aware of it, that I could not make that claim in the first place. </p>
<p>Socrates: Ah! And if you cannot make the claim that you have experienced without first being aware, does saying that you have a subjective experience not imply <em>awareness</em> of having a subjective experience?</p>
<p>Plato: Yes, I suppose so, if one is a requisite for the other. Yet, if I may point out, awareness is merely a sort of thought, is it not? It is a thought that references another. And as I have said, thoughts are themselves a kind of subjective experience. So, it seems, there are two separate things that I have &quot;felt&quot; whenever I say I am aware of something. One is the experience itself, and the other is the awareness of the experience, which is itself a sort of experience. </p>
<p>Socrates: An interesting hypothesis. So let us again set the stage. Plato sits on his bench, stares at the sky, and says that he sees blue. Presumably, blue light has entered his eyes, and has made some sort of electrical imprint upon his brain. Then, he says to me that he is aware of it. What he really means is that not only has he experienced something, he also has another experience, an awareness of having experienced it! </p>
<p>Plato: I suppose he has. </p>
<p>Socrates: And yet, as we have said, awareness itself is a sort of experience. </p>
<p>Plato: Yes. </p>
<p>Socrates: And to experience something necessarily implies an awareness of it. </p>
<p>Plato: I believe so. </p>
<p>Socrates: So to say you have two experiences, one of the initial experience of blue light, and one of the awareness of the initial experience, implies that you in fact have three experiences! For you could not experience the second experience without having an awareness of it, and this awareness is itself an experience. So now you have three experiences; the initial one, the awareness of the initial one, and the awareness of the awareness of the initial one.... Yet to say you have three experiences actually implies that you have four! </p>
<p>Plato: How horrifying! The experiences seem to multiply like hydra! Yet perhaps I am not surprised that such a self-referential idea leads to an infinite regress. Indeed, I am so confused I hardly know myself.</p>
<p>Socrates: We know two things. One, that to experience something implies a corresponding awareness, a &quot;reference thought&quot; to that experience. Two, that awareness is itself a kind of experience. Yet together, they result in a contradiction; an infinite loop. </p>
<p>Plato: Yet the key idea, that subjective experience implies awareness, seems sound - for it is impossible to say you have experienced something without first being aware of it. So it follows that there exists a thought that is not experienced. A reference that is itself unreferenced. </p>
<p>Socrates: So it seems. And this itself is not so hard to believe; if you have a stream of thoughts, each referencing the one before it; there is bound to be one where the referencing stops. For how could we possibly go about our day, always thinking about our own thoughts the whole time? </p>
<p>Plato: Great question. I was just wondering that myself. Yet to think that there is a thought with no corresponding subjective experience is disconcerting. I suppose this follows naturally from the fact that if something is said to be experienced, it must then have been made aware of. With no reference thought, there is no way to say that that thought even happened. It is, in a sense, lost - at least until it is referenced, that is. </p>
<p>Socrates: That&#39;s an interesting way to put it. A thought lost in memory with no claim to a corresponding subjective experience... You might go as far to say that all thoughts are originally like this. Until they are referenced by another thought, that they cannot be said to be experienced. So let me again ask my original question, for I never seemed to get a satisfactory answer; what, exactly, do you mean when you say you are conscious? </p>
<p>Plato: I suppose I have a pair of mental processes; one is the actual imprint that the blue makes upon my mind, and one is the awareness of the thought. In this two-thought system, there is only one &quot;subjective experience&quot; - lest we fall into the void of self-reference. </p>
<p>Socrates: Where, exactly, is this &quot;subjective experience&quot;? </p>
<p>Plato: In the initial experience itself, I would presume!</p>
<p>Socrates: How can this be? For without the thought to reference <em>it</em>, it is lost. I hope you are not saying  that something you are not even aware of can be conscious.</p>
<p>Plato: Fine. Perhaps the awareness, the &quot;reference thought&quot;, is the conscious one; for it <em>is</em> the thing that is aware. </p>
<p>Socrates: Again, you contradict yourself. How can the reference thought be conscious, when there is nothing to be conscious of <em>it</em>? </p>
<p>Plato: The more I talk with you, the more concerned I become. Are you implying that consciousness does not reside in any mental process? If none of the thoughts in a system can be conscious, you are saying is that no thoughts can be conscious. </p>
<p>Socrates: This is what you have said yourself. </p>
<p>Plato: And yet, there does seem to be <em>something</em> there. Subjective experiences, <em>qualia</em>, can exist in neither experience independently, for it is impossible to say you are conscious with a single thought. Yet somehow, they exist when we see the system together... </p>
<hr>
<h3>Part 3: Analysis</h3>
<p>Let us seriously consider the substance of this discussion. </p>
<p>First, let us put the word consciousness aside for a moment, as Plato and Socrates have done, in order to focus on the real nature of the matter, which is the idea of &quot;subjective experience&quot;, or <em>qualia</em>, which constitute the Hard Problem of Consciousness posed by Chalmers. </p>
<p>I should stop for a moment to say that Plato uses many words to refer to what he thinks are &quot;subjective experiences&quot;: among them; thought, awareness, imagination, memory, and experience. It is quite difficult to use these words without becoming mixed-up on their meaning, as has been made clear in the dialogue. For now, we will refer to each of the three - thought, awareness, and experience - as just &quot;thoughts&quot;, and to the idea of &quot;subjective experiences&quot; as <em>qualia</em>. Thoughts are merely mental processes that can be referenced, or &quot;made aware&quot;, by other thoughts. We will see soon why this blanket term is reasonable. There is a distinction here to be made, a subtle one, at the heart of the preceding discussion, and that is that what Plato means by &quot;experience&quot; - that is, thought; is not the same as what Socrates means by &quot;experience&quot; - that is, <em>qualia</em>. Socrates acknowledges that Plato has thoughts, in that he has active cognitive processes, yet Socrates is looking for something different - he wants to identify where exactly it is from these thoughts that <em>qualia</em> emerge. This is the core of the consciousness debate. </p>
<p>One idea that arises quite quickly is the fact that to have a &quot;claim to qualia&quot; necessitates awareness - awareness being, in Plato&#39;s mind, a kind of experience, or thought. If you are not aware of something, you cannot say that you have qualitatively experienced it. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;Transitivity Principle&quot; in literature. </p>
<p>Yet there is an idea at odds with the Transitivity Principle. That every thought exists as a qualitative experience. Together, these two ideas are incompatible. They are, to use a programming analogy, like two functions that call each other, yet never &quot;bottom out&quot;, leading to infinite recursion. If thoughts are equivalent to qualia, and qualia necessitate awareness (a thought that references the previous one), then that new thought must necessitate yet another awareness, which is itself a thought, ad infinitum. Since infinite thoughts cannot exist in a mind at once (an impossibility provided that the mind has limited time and storage), we must abandon the idea of each thought having a corresponding qualitative experience. </p>
<p>This is also why it is impossible for a thought to be its own reference - for to be aware of itself, it would have to be aware of its awareness of itself, and so on. This is referred to the homunculus fallacy, commonly posed in terms of the theory of vision. If one defines seeing to be some process whereby an internal observer within a mind becomes aware of optical input, like movies on a TV screen, the question arises of how that internal observer sees. It must too have an internal observer, leading to infinite regress. There is always an awareness &quot;unseen&quot; by higher order awareness. This is also why &quot;self awareness&quot; in the strongest temporal sense is impossible - there is always at least one thought that goes unreferenced. </p>
<p>The importance of this statement needs to be made clear. A thought cannot understand itself. You cannot be aware of yourself. The notion of consciousness as a &quot;unified self-awareness&quot; is ill-formed. You can only be aware of past states of yourself, not present ones. You, your mind, is split. </p>
<p>Therefore, the fundamental unit of qualia, in our model, is dependent on time. In Plato and Socrates&#39; model, the unit was thought of as a thought-pair, where one thought - which in Plato&#39;s case was the initial experience of the sky - serves as the reference of another - the &quot;awareness&quot; that Plato recounted. In this model of cognitive processes, we assume that the mind is <em>single-threaded</em> (another analogy from computation) that means that the mind can only think one thing at once. Therefore, the two thoughts are necessarily separated by time - the first thought occurs at time T1 and the other at time T2. </p>
<p>I should acknowledge that this sort of model is a drastic simplification of the complexity of true neural activity. There is a degree of abstraction here that is necessary, yet like all models of psychology, neural activity itself may not map so easily onto our cut-and-dried abstract model of a mind. But neuroscience is not yet well-equipped to tackle problems like consciousness. The hope is to find overarching ideas that arise despite the extreme complexity of a system like a human brain. It is also true that the mind can do more than one thing at once - drive a car and chew gum, for example, but it is unclear that the mind can be <em>aware</em> of more than one thing at once. This is why this abstraction is useful. </p>
<p>The question becomes, then, where exactly is this <em>qualia</em> that Socrates has been searching for? Where is it, what is it, and why is it?</p>
<p>Plato and Socrates examine the thought-pair, and come to the conclusion that neither one, independently, can be said to embody qualitative experience. Again, the &quot;subject&quot; thought is certainly not conscious alone, and certainly not at the moment it was experienced. This might be surprising to hear, for it implies that qualia are not immediate - they do not arise &quot;at birth&quot; from the subject thought, because of the time differential between T1 and T2. In fact, since this time differential can be arbitrarily large, some thoughts do not get referenced until much further in the future. A common example is driving a familiar route home from work, then &quot;coming to&quot; at home and realizing that even though you experienced the route home, you did not reference it until this moment. </p>
<p>Some proponents of higher order theories of consciousness believe that the subject thought at T1 &quot;gains consciousness&quot; once it is referenced. There is no reason to believe this is the case, for the simple reason that you cannot change what has happened in the past. They neglect causality. Nothing at event T2 can change the nature of the event at T1. </p>
<p>Then can this &quot;awareness&quot; of a previous thought - let us refer to it as the &quot;reference&quot; thought, be said to embody qualitative experience? This is closer to the truth, although still flawed. The question becomes why qualia would emerge at thought T2, when T2 is not itself conscious. We are not aware of having experienced T2 until we construct another thought at T3 that references <em>it</em>. Therefore, T2 alone has no &quot;claim to qualia.&quot; </p>
<p>Analyzing the individual thoughts yields nothing. This is where higher order theories of consciousness fail. We are forced to grapple with the idea that qualia as we conceive of them are not states, in the way that the state of mind at T1 or T2 was a state, nor do they assume certain properties when referenced that suddenly give them qualia. They are non-isolable: they cannot be said to reside in a state. Rather, qualia have to lie in <em>relationships</em> between states. The idea of <em>qualia</em> as we conceive of them is inextricably linked with the idea of the relationship between the thought at T1 and the one at T2. The implications to this statement are significant. </p>
<p>Consciousness, then, (in the &quot;subjective experience&quot; sense), is not a state, but a process. It is the process by which states reference each other. The notion that consciousness is not a state is very easy to support; for instance, if you were to &quot;freeze&quot; a human in place so that every function, even the current thought, would be resumed once un-frozen, it is still difficult to believe that the human is conscious while frozen. Yet this fact goes too often unrecognized - we hear often of people &quot;losing consciousness&quot; or machines &quot;gaining consciousness&quot; as if they are states that can be achieved. </p>
<p>It may be useful at this point to discuss what, exactly, thoughts are. Earlier I operated under the assumption that all of Plato&#39;s terms - memory, experience, awareness, among them - we would refer to as thoughts. This generalization was not merely for convenience. These ideas all have one thing in common - they are mental states that can be referenced by other mental states at some point in the future. Yet still this classification may seem uncomfortable, for it implies that the things that Plato <em>felt</em> - the blue photons entering his retina, the nerve signals from the bench under his hands, were not truly felt. Rather, it was a thought <em>containing</em> the stimulus that was being referenced. Furthermore, what exactly does it mean for a thought to <em>contain</em> stimulus? Is this not also a kind of reference, from the thought to the stimulus?   </p>
<p>To tackle these questions, we must introduce the idea of memory. Memories were grouped under the umbrella of thoughts, yet it would be more accurate to say that a thought is merely an instance of memory. Memories are those things that can be referenced in the future by other thoughts. Since there is always a temporal difference between the two thoughts in the thought-pairs of awareness, it can be said that the thought at T2 was only referencing the <em>memory</em> of T1. The idea of one thought referencing another, without the conception of memory, is ill-defined, for it is memory that lends temporal accessibility to thoughts. You cannot reference something that no longer exists. </p>
<p>How then, are memories created? And what is its relation to the idea of stimulus? The answer to this in the broadest sense is that memories are created through mental activity. We know that some thoughts certainly create memories. And yet there is a connection to be made here, which will be elaborated later, to &quot;unknowability&quot; - that is, the fact that unless a mental process is written to memory, it cannot be made conscious nor acknowledged. Therefore it is possible that some thoughts are not written to memory. We simply cannot tell. </p>
<p>What, then, is stimulus? Stimulus is the impact of senses on the mind. When a stimulus is written to memory, it is called an &quot;experience&quot; - a term that Plato confused with the idea of &quot;subjective experience.&quot; It is arguable that stimulus is the <em>only</em> thing that can write to memory, and that thoughts are merely a form of stimulus - ones that originate somewhere within the brain rather than from nerves that feed into the brainstem. Certainly it is simpler to think of it this way; and there is good reason to. It unifies both external senses and thoughts into experiences (not subjective ones, remember), which correspond nicely with our notions of being able to reference experiences through their memories. Ultimately this is a semantic distinction. </p>
<p>What happens when Plato looks into the sky? The stimulus creates an experience, which is merely the name for stimulus that writes to memory. This memory can then be referenced by thoughts. It is again a semantic distinction as to whether or not this initial experience is a kind of thought - in the traditional sense of the word it is likely not, but for our purposes we will group them together in the umbrella of &quot;experiences (stored in memory) that can be later referenced.&quot; For now, let us continue to refer to this set as &quot;thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us come back to the question at hand - where are qualia? What are they? And why do we believe that they exist? </p>
<p>Consciousness are the mental references that lead us to the idea of consciousness. </p>
<p>We can only perceive a representation of reality</p>
<p>Senses are writing to memory. </p>
<p>Consciousness is the process of reference, and qualia are the signature of memory. </p>
<p>Animal pain is first order. Human pain is both first and second order. First order pain is physiological. </p>
<p><em>Qualia are the signature of memory.</em> They are the things that thoughts &quot;point to&quot;. You can&#39;t &quot;point to a thought&quot;</p>
<p>Lastly, we come to the question of why. Why </p>
<p>Then is the subject thought conscious?  This might be surprising to hear, for we believe that all of our thoughts have consciousness associated with them. But this is a subtle deception. By the time it happens, by the time we believe that a thought has qualia, awareness, associated with it, we have already reflected. To have reflected implies a reference thought. Awareness is thus inseparable from reference. </p>
<p>Key ideas:<br>Infinite regress/self-referencing thought/ryle&#39;s regress<br>Cognitive representations of reality<br>End of self-reference<br>Qualia are the signature of memory<br>Awareness as experience<br>unknowable depth to the mind<br>Consciousness-as-process rather than consciousness-as-state.<br>Stimulus as memory. </p>
<h5>Part 4: Implications</h5>
<p>We cannot perceive reality directly. We can only perceive a representation of reality. XYZ has said this 200 years ago, but the implications to consciousness have not been fully realized. We are not conscious of reality, we are conscious of a representation of reality. </p>
<p>Plato: I am following you thus far. </p>
<p>// things not covered: the idea of temporal reference/single threadedness/impossibility of a temporally self-referencing thought. This is the mistake of ryle&#39;s regress.<br>// </p>
<p>There is an awareness unaware, a reference that itself has not been referenced. </p>
<p>Socrates: If experience necessitates awareness, then to say </p>
<p>Proof by contradiction: you cannot have:<br>experience imply awareness<br>Awareness be a kind of experience<br>Or it leads to an infinite regress. There must be a stop somewhere; a thought, an awareness, that has not been experienced. </p>
<p>Socrates: Let me clarify what I mean by experience. Merely the physical process of light entering retina, electrical impulses into brain, etc. </p>
<p>Socrates: What do we mean by experience? I have said that experience is merely an imprint upon the mind that you can observe. But you may have a different definition; I suspect you think it has something to do with &quot;qualia&quot; or &quot;a way it is like&quot; like we talked about with blue-ness. This is, I suspect, what people usually mean by consciousness. Let us separate these two definitions. </p>
<p>*Here is where it may be useful to define our terms a little better. So far, I have used the word &quot;experience&quot; as a way to describe the imprint that the senses make upon your mind. In other words, &quot;experiences&quot; are merely the *</p>
<p>Plato: Before this point in time, I thought these two were the same thing; inseparable. But I suppose thus far we have been talking about slightly different things. </p>
<p>Socrates: yes, subtle distinctions confuse philosophers, etc. Awareness is also a thought, which is also experience, etc. </p>
<p>So let me ask you the question again. Can you say that that you have &quot;subjective qualia&quot;, without being aware of them? </p>
<p>Plato: No, same as before. </p>
<p>Socrates: Which means they are inseparable. To have subjective qualia you mist have awareness of the subjective qualia. </p>
<p>Plato: Wait, infinite regress! You have locked me into a corner!</p>
<p>Socrates: Well yes, but no. Infinite regress is impossible, </p>
<p>Socrates: Yet you believe that you have qualia. Do they reside in the experience? Or the reference</p>
<p>Plato: Well maybe they just exist in the experience!</p>
<p>Socrates: But qualia cannot exist in experience without having a reference, so quialia cannot be explicitly isolated to the experience<br>So is the experience conscious? It cannot be, for without awareness of experience, you cannot make the claim that you are conscious. </p>
<p>Plato: Well maybe they exist in the reference!</p>
<p>Socrates: But to for qualia, subjective experience to occur in the reference thought, we encounter the same problem, for there is nothing to be conscious of IT!</p>
<p>So is the awareness conscious? It cannot be, for there is nothing to be conscious of IT. </p>
<p>Plato: How terrifying, etc. </p>
<p>Socrates: here is the key idea: To describe qualia, or what-it&#39;s-likeness, you need a reference thought. You cannot say you experience qualia without referencing it first. that to say we are conscious we need only believe we are conscious, and to believe we are conscious requires reflection. </p>
<p>*You are aware of experience, therefore you experience. *</p>
<p>Plato: So where do you think qualia are? When I describe blue-ness, what am I describing? There must be something there!</p>
<p>Socrates: Let us analyze. They cannot exist in the reference (awareness), nor in the experience (the imprint). They exist in neither independently, for it is impossible to say you are conscious with a single thought. Yet somehow, they exist when we see the system together! So it must have something to do with the relationship between the experience, the subject, and the awareness, the reference thought. </p>
<p>Plato: I am following you thus far. </p>
<p>Socrates: Let me ask you another question. (make a link to memory) You know that you can only reference things in the past (lest we run into infinite regress), and referencing things in the past is like memory. We know qualia exist only when thoughts are referenced, so h</p>
<p>Qualia are the signature of memory. </p>
<p>Awareness is a kind of experience. Awareness requires self-referentiality. Experience is<br>Special things happen when you are aware of an </p>
<p>The thought unthought, the seeing unseen. The structure that is defined with references, yet has no base reference. The linked list lost in memory. </p>
<p>Plato: But perhaps the awareness <em>is</em> an infinite regress. Is it not possible for a thought to be aware of itself? For the thought itself to be its own reference? Is this not what consciousness is? </p>
<p>Socrates: No. This is impossible. For to be fully aware of itself, it would have to be fully aware of its awareness of itself, and thus fully aware of its awareness of itself of its awareness of itself, and so on. There is simply not enough time, nor space, for infinite awareness. </p>
<p>Consciousness is not a state that one can be in. Nor is it a substance, an essence, localized to a mind. Rather, it is an action. It is the process of reference itself, qualia being merely the signature, the subject, of this reference. </p>
<p>Plato: So the holy and indescribable feeling, of living, of experience, of being itself, is merely a parting gust in the space between thought and thought. We have solved the problem of defining consciousness, Socrates. We leave merely our images. </p>
<p>Things, even thoughts, have no meaning unless they are a reference of another thought. </p>
<p>Let us sit down and seriously consider the substance of this discussion. </p>

<p>There is an unknowable depth to the mind. The proof to this unknowable depth can be summarized in one simple phrase: &quot;you are not conscious of what you are not conscious of.&quot; As julian jaynes writes in &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot;, trying to &quot;it is like asking a flashlight in a dark room to search around for something that does not have any light on it. &quot;</p>
<p>Consciousness is reducible to self-awareness, for the simple reason that we cannot know we are conscious (experiencing things) without being self-aware. </p>
<p>Let us begin by constructing a mind much like our own. </p>
<p>What is it that chooses what you are aware of? Nothing. It is not under your control. Perhaps?  </p>
