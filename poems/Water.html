        <p>The man lies sick with a knotted chest<br />
wishing he could burst into<br />
a violent explosion of sticky-notes<br />
or a silent collapse of honey-like syrup, viscous<br />
or some bang of gunpowdered jelly, <br />
a more-massive-than-thou slow-motion splash<br />
constituent water droplets spreading, <br />
a satisfying crash, then draining into greedy pavement, <br />
somehow quenching the thirst of<br />
something greater than him, not him, <br />
<em>fooom! ssshhhplash!</em><br />
no, not him. </p>
