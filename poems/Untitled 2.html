        <p>when the moth does it, we complain of </p>
<p>half-promised wind-drops on the evening news</p>
<p><em>…well folks, don’t let the sunshine fool you…</em></p>
<p>when the rich do it, we say <em>eat the rich</em>,</p>
<p>we say five-sigma, and blame</p>
<p>the folly of complex financial derivatives</p>
<p>when the cell does it, metastasis we say, and</p>
<p><em>sorry, there’s nothing more we can do</em></p>
<p>when the artist does it, genius we say, </p>
<p>and nothing more </p>
<p>and none are ever the wiser</p>
<p>when the atom does it, we call it proliferation,</p>
<p>that uncertain balance of terror, </p>
<p>the damn commies</p>
