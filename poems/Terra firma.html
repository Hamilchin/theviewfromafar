        <h2>Terra firma</h2>
        </pre>
        
        <p>Green grass has loved the crust that holds it firm<br />
fallacious sheets who clash and speak of slights<br />
like: <em>you and me, we each one have our score!</em><br />
<em>But Pangea had a ringing clotted shore!</em><br />
The red of densely forme’d petal slaked<br />
has roots in ferrous oxide, or the morgue. <br />
The flower peeks then shrinks away its bud- <br />
green grass has never seen this one before. </p>
<p>When light peers through the trenches deep,<br />
The sun will find a mineral-densely-packed - <br />
so sibilant as to prevent the flight <br />
of any other foes that, glaring down<br />
disturb amorphous* houses of spun-glass:<br />
(*the structures had their issues setting back)<br />
Granules cry their foul, and their kin,<br />
will crush the teeth of any chomping in.</p>
<p>It’s certain that this dirt of mine demurs,<br />
Yielding quick to flesh and quick to sheen, <br />
Oil slick opines that he is lost; <br />
his flattened visage beacon-light and mute.</p>
<p>Sheer buttress yields its frank whispers anew<br />
Clearing sights through gnarled windward fall<br />
Pray dispense with much that, hearing now,<br />
A billion ashen motes would windward wake</p>
<p>So let fly those gleaming twisted locks,<br />
and free those joyous whipping boots of yours,<br />
(the ones that skip through nearly half-a-crete - <br />
that slave to cover aching gravel feet)<br />
And tow this cache of soil through<br />
the river styx, now only dry moraine- <br />
Bear the weight of chronic crushing slag<br />
Mantle up a bitter beaming flame, <br />
Tired too the iron has become<br />
churning up the clay and grit again.</p>
<p>Forget what metamorphic forces brought you forth,<br />
forget those sordid years when you were born,<br />
Watch it split your pious rings adore, <br />
but love the crust that holds you ever firm, <br />
and ask not where your children flew before-<br />
to green grass, we will see you nevermore.</p>
