        <p>This is a small repository for my writings. </p>
<p>My writing philosophy is simple: write often, write wrong (often), and expose ideas, especially the ones you most believe, to others. </p>
<p>Ideas are antifragile. They need exposure to critique to become stronger. Trying to break an idea is one of the best things you can do to it. </p>
<p>Writing is an amazing tool. One of the best inventions of the past four thousand millenia, for sure. It allows you to spread out your ideas across time, where future-you can critique the ideas of past-you in something akin to a socratic dialogue. It is another </p>
<p>Please, do not think that just because I say something, it is true! </p>
<p>Write as true as a straight arrow. </p>
<p>Honesty means not being polished when your ideas are not polished. <br />
It means not being held back by the pull of perfection, the fear of permanence. <br />
You can always write, re-write, re-write. Writing already existing should not hinder your ability or willingness to write again; it should do the opposite. <br />
George Colligan and the pots. When you free yourself from the "one draft<br />
disease, rewriting itself becomes easier, which paradoxically means you write more, and write better.</p>
<p>Honesty means not writing down a final draft at first. It means getting your ideas down. It means not showing off. It means realizing that writing is a medium for thought, not for authorship. </p>
<p>Write the MVP of an idea. You cherish your sentences, are afraid of losing them, because they are so rare. Embrace prosperity. </p>
<p>Dispense with the pomp and circumstance. Sketches should not have an audience in mind. They should have a Carole Lee I'm meeting next Tuesday. </p>
<p>What writing style should I adopt? </p>
<p>So far, I've trained to be pretentious and perhaps too formal. This is what the pull of writing english essays does to a fella. It doesn't help that I read many old books (60+ y/o) that probably could say what they meant in 50% of the space. </p>
<p>I do this because that's what the people I read sound like. The "informal" writing I consume too often comes in informal settings; advertisements, social media, and the like. As such, I've tended to associate "truthy" writing with a particular style. But I don't think it's as efficient as it could be. It doesn't really match the cadence of my "internal monologue", and I've succumbed to the temptation to make flashily worded sentences even when they are harder to understand. </p>
<p>My main worry is that people have a similar unspoken bias to writing that is worded succinctly. I know that I certainly do, to some degree. And I'm sure many philosophers do, given how verbose many are. </p>
<p>Another worry is that I'm adopting a cold tone. I certainly don't mean to, but it's difficult to be warm without being informal, I've found. maybe i should start writing things without capital letters. i've seen some other people do this. how cutesy. </p>
<p>Am I writing for myself, or for others?</p>
<p>I'm afraid that there is a difference between the two. Notes to self assume a working memory of the relevant information. Public posts do not, if you want to make it a useful experience for the reader. If we only consider writer-side information, I have a suspicion that you can cut away at any piece of knowledge until it is the most bare-bones expression of the relevant idea. These are notes to self; something very close to pure thought. Yet there is something to be said about the transition from ideas in head to ideas in the open; Feynman, possibly the best lecturer of all time, famously said something about how you can't say you understand something without being able to explain it to others (or something like that). It's surprisingly hard to go from thought to coherent writing: you discover sometimes that there are holes in your argument, or that there are gaps that you have not fully understood. I write a little more about this in [The Benefits of Writing]. </p>
