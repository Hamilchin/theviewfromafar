        <h2>About</h2></pre>
        
        <p>Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! </p>
<p>Writing is an amazing tool. One of the best inventions of the past ~four thousand millenia, for sure. It primarily plays the role of enabling dialogue with the self. It allows you to spread out your ideas across time, where future-you is freed to critique the ideas of past you. </p>
<p>My writing philosophy is simple: write often, write wrong (often), and expose ideas, especially the ones you most believe, to others. </p>
<p>It is my opinion that honest, vigorous disagreement is by far one of the most productive forms of dialogue. Ideas are antifragile. They need exposure to critique to become stronger. Trying to break an idea is one of the best things you can do to it. </p>
<p>This blog is not static. It will constantly change as ideas do. At no point do I expect it to be "complete" or "polished." This is a mistake I've made many, many times in my life, and it inevitably leads to ruin. As such, there are no guarantees on quality, correctness, or originality. The things you will see are the roughest of the rough drafts; This is a point I cannot stress enough. </p>
<p>Epistemic humility. I am of the opinion that there is no belief one should hold that is immune to evidence. </p>
<p>Some people write to convince</p>
<p>Q: What's in the name? <br />
A: "The view from afar" is the name of the blog I've wanted to start since I was a young lad. It represents distancing yourself from the first-person perspective in which you spend most of your life - "zooming out", so to speak - and looking at the world in the broadest possible light. This blog is highly third-person; I don't plan to write much about myself.  </p>
<p>Q: How did you make this site?<br />
A: See <a href="https://github.com/Hamilchin/theviewfromafar/blob/main/README.md">this document</a> for some of my design philosophy and source structure. </p>
<p>Q: Why don't you polish your writing? <br />
A: I wish I could! There are two obstacles: <br />
1. I am a hopeless perfectionist, and if I ever open the door to polishing something, said thing will never get done. <br />
2. Unfortunately, re-drafting is one of the most time-consuming parts of writing, and at this point I think I get much higher returns by just writing more things. </p>
<p>Q: Why do you make your writing public? <br />
A: So curious people can read it and disagree with me, and as a motivation to write more often. </p>
<p>Q: For some reason, I like reading your stuff and would like to read more of it. What should I do? <br />
A: Thanks! I have a mailing list <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6QNCPNiTR-cs8fej-B9AamsPl7CjxUZww9-7hBUfM__G9CQ/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109574609719519675919">here</a>, though there are no guarantees on temporal consistency of communication. </p>
<p>Cheers, and thanks for stopping by. <br />
