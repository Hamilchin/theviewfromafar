        <p>Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! </p>
<p>The View from Afar is a blog in which I post a smattering of ideas, reflections, philosophical musings, book reviews, poems, and other miscellaneous writing. </p>
<p>Writing is an amazing tool. It's definitely one of the best inventions of the past four thousand millenia. The superpower it gives us is the temporal coherence of ideas; with writing, you get to spread out your ideas across time, where future-you is freed to critique the ideas of past you. This not only enables long-term information storage, but it also enables dialogue with the self. Writing is as much of a tool for thinking as it is for communication. </p>
<p><strong>When it comes to ideas, reflections, and philosophical writings</strong>, my philosophy is simple; write often, write wrong (often), and expose ideas, especially the ones you most believe, to vigorous criticism by both yourself and others. Ideas are antifragile. They need exposure to become stronger. Trying to refute a good idea is paradoxically one of the best things you can do to make it better.</p>
<p>This blog is not static. It will constantly change, like its constituent ideas do. At no point do I expect it to be "complete" or "polished." As a hopeless perfectionist, this is a mistake I've made many, many times in my life, and it invariably leads to ruin. Again and again I've found that when it comes to getting stuff out there, it's a much better strategy to prioritize quantity over quality. </p>
<p>As such - and this is a point I want to stress - the goal of this blog is not to make convincing, polished claims. It is first and foremost a thinking tool, a way to develop ideas that stand up to inspection both from myself and others. </p>
<p>When an idea has been brewing in my mind for a little while, it often finds itself on paper. The ones that I think are worth elaborating on are called "sketches" - they come in PDF form for your convenience. The ones that I jot down quickly can be found in "idea garden"; essentially a mega-doc for things that I find interesting, have questions about, or want to explore more. In both cases, I do little to no proofreading, so please let me know if you find any typos! </p>
<p>I am a big believer in epistemic humility. I don't think there should be a single belief you hold that you have no possibility of changing. This is as true for the ideas in this blog as it is for anything else. To that end, please do not confuse the tone of my writing being very matter-of-fact with the ideas themselves being matters of fact. Much of the time my writing is exploratory; it tests out new ideas. I believe them, but if you disagree, you should tell me why, and I may very well change them. I try to write my ideas, like any good philosopher, as if I know them to be true. To this, I say (and I hope you remember it whenever you are reading my writing, or anyone else's, for that matter): do not mistake confidence in writing for accuracy of thought. Keep your mind open, but don't lose your critical eye. </p>
<p><strong>This site is also a repository for more creative writing, like poems</strong>. Writing is also a creative discipline, and I have been exploring the creative space recently. Please feel free to let me know what you think. </p>
<p>Q&amp;A: </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Who are you? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: My name is Alexander, and you can find my personal site <a href="https://hamilchin.github.com">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What's in the name? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: "The view from afar" is the name of the blog I came up with back when I was around 13. It represents distancing yourself from the first-person perspective in which you spend most of your life - "zooming out", so to speak - and looking at the world in the broadest possible light. This blog is highly third-person; I don't plan to write much about myself.  </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How did you make this site? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: See <a href="https://github.com/Hamilchin/theviewfromafar/blob/main/README.md">this document</a> for some of my design philosophy and source structure. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You mentioned that you wanted people to critique your ideas. Where should we do this? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: Form coming soon! For now, email me at chinalexan at gmail dot com with any thoughts whatsoever. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why don't you polish your writing, then post it when it is good enough? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: I wish I could! There are two main obstacles: <br />
- I am a hopeless perfectionist, and nothing is ever "good enough." If I ever open the door to polishing something, that something is never getting done. <br />
- Re-drafting is one of the more time-consuming parts of writing. At this point, I think I think it's better to focus on just writing more things. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why do you make your writing public? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: As a motivation to write more often, to have handy links to send people, and so curious people can read it and disagree with me. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: For some strange reason, I like reading your stuff and would like to read more of it. What should I do? <br />
<strong>A</strong>: Thanks! I have a mailing list <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6QNCPNiTR-cs8fej-B9AamsPl7CjxUZww9-7hBUfM__G9CQ/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109574609719519675919">here</a>, though I give no guarantees on temporal consistency of communication. </p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Alexander</p>
