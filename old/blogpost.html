        <div class="content">
            <p> There are few problems in the history of thought that have been so enduring as the problem of consciousness. Our minds aim not only to know what we are made of, or how we act, but *why* we are - that is, why there is a way, a feeling, that it is like *to be*. And yet, a satisfactory answer has eluded us. We have given many names to this problem, among them, the Hard Problem of Consciousness, which formulates the question in terms of the existence of so-called *qualia*, or subjective experience. These terms, the ones that refer to experience itself, are remarkably difficult to describe rigorously. Perhaps it is not surprising that words so often fail to describe consciousness, for if we could describe it entirely, we would be well on our way to solving the problem. And thus, we are forced to ask, and answer, a question whose meaning is not well defined. Understandably, we have failed.</p>
